My name is Giovanni. I'm italian living between Paraguay and Argentina.  
In the pre bitcoin era I was a sailor and boatbuilder.  
Since I discovered Bitcoin in 2014 I left my previous life and worked online as disputes analyist at Localbitcoins Oy.  
Today I'm a wannabe full stack web developer and cypherpunk Bitcoin maximalist, working with Nodejs, Nuxtjs, Btcpay Server and Bitcoinjs.
