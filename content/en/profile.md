My name is Giovanni.  
I'm italian living between Paraguay and Argentina.  
In the pre bitcoin era I was a sailor and boatbuilder.  
Since I discovered Bitcoin in 2014 I left my previous life to work online as disputes analyist at Localbitcoins Oy.  
I'm a self made nodejs and nuxt developer.  
I also like Btcpay Server and bitcoinjs-lib a lot.
